## Loading and preprocessing the data

dataset <- read.csv('activity.csv')
dataset_by_day <- aggregate(dataset$steps, by=list(dataset$date), sum)

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

mean(dataset_by_day$x, na.rm = T) #10766.19

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

#we first find the maximum number of steps and store it in max_steps
max_steps <- max(dataset$steps, na.rm = T)
#then use this value to find the interval
max_interval <- dataset$interval[dataset$steps==max_steps]
sum(max_interval, na.rm = T) #615

## Imputing missing values

dataset_imputed <- dataset
dataset_imputed$steps[is.na(dataset_imputed$steps)] <- mean(dataset$steps, na.rm = T)
summary(dataset_imputed)

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Yes, according to the plots
